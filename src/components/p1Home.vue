    <h3 class="text-left text-dark">The Problem</h3>
    <p>Many people don't have robust support networks, with nearby people they really trust.  The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated this difficulty; even if you have a spouse or caretaker, it’s hard to figure out who will help with tasks and companionship should someone fall ill.  Many people are setting up networks to deliver discrete help, like grocery pickup, when the need arises—but what about when the need spikes 1000-fold in a few weeks?  </p>

    <h3 class="text-left text-dark">The Solution</h3>
    <p>3Caretakers is about setting up “Clusters of Care” NOW, with three caretakers matched to one person in need.  The Clusters are a mix of your existing network and altruistic strangers.  </p>
    <p>It's about building a trustworthy group to last through the crisis, not just for the duration of one errand.</p>

    <h3 class="text-left text-dark"><b>Key Benefits: </b></h3>
    <ul class="text-left">
      <li>
        <p><b>Redundancy.</b> With 3+ helpers, there will likely be someone available to help, even if other volunteers get sick or are unable to commit.  If your situation warrants it, we’ll add more caretakers to your cluster. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Trust:</b> Though volunteers are strangers, we verify their phone number (which can be traced in case of scammers) and offer additional verification (photo ID matching). </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Self-policing:</b> The hope is that a group of three caretakers and one person in need will regulate itself.  Setting up group communication and chats means that other people can see the conversation, offer new suggestions, and hold each other accountable.  </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Distributing the burden makes it easier to help:</b> During times of crisis, we all need to be careful not to take on too many obligations.  Setting up a caretaking cluster means the responsibility doesn’t fall to only one person.  This might get people to volunteer who would be hesitant of the typical 1-on-1 match.</p>
